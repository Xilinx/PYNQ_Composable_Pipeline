# Composable Pipeline

The Composable pipeline is an overlay with a novel and clever architecture that allow us to adapt how the data flows between a series of IP cores.

The key characteristic of a composable overlay is an AXI4-Stream Switch, which plays the same role as an old [telephone switchboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_switchboard). The AXI4-Stream Switch provides the runtime routing of how data flow from one IP core to another.

On top of that, the composable overlay includes Dynamic Function eXchange [DFX](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/implementation/dynamic-function-exchange.html) regions that brings new functionality to the design at runtime.

The combination of these two technologies plus a pythonic API, built on top of [pynq](http://www.pynq.io/), provide an unprecedented flexibility.

## Supported Boards

* [PYNQ-Z1](boards/Pynq-Z1/README.md)
* [PYNQ-Z2](boards/Pynq-Z2/README.md)
* [PYNQ-ZU](boards/Pynq-ZU/README.md)
* [Kria KV260](boards/KV260/README.md)

> Note: PYNQ-Z1 is supported with the same composable overlay as PYNQ-Z2

To rebuild the composable pipeline you need Vitis and Vivado 2022.1. Navigate to one of the supported boards folder and run `make`, only steps for Linux are provided.

## Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ_Composable_Pipeline.git --recursive
```

Note that this project depends on the [Vitis Accelerated Libraries](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries) and [PYNQ](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ)

## Install composable pipeline on your board

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ_Composable_Pipeline
python3 -m pip install PYNQ_Composable_Pipeline/ --no-build-isolation
pynq-get-notebooks pynq_composable -p $PYNQ_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOKS
```

The notebooks will be delivered into the folder `/home/xilinx/jupyter_notebooks`
