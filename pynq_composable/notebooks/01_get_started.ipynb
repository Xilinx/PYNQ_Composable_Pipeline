    "The `applications` folder provides predefined vision applications wrapped into a pythonic API that exposes the functionality to the user and abstracts away the complexity of the composable pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the `custom_pipeline` folder provides a deep dive into the composable overlay architecture and the intermediate API to control and create custom pipelines. The composable overlay is presented and the through the notebooks all the features are explored. \n",

    "It is recommended to start exploring the `applications` folder to understand how powerful the composable overlay is."
